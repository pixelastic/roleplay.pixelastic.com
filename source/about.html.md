## About

This website holds screenshots and video footage of various videogames I played.
I built this because playing a great videogame is like going on vacation in
a nice place. It's nice to look at pictures afterwards.

I used to play World of Warcraft a long time ago, and I still have screenshots
of that time sitting on a hard drive somewhere. I still like looking at them.
I wanted to keep some memories of all the games I played, so I created this
place to host them.

Some of games I play on Steam on Linux, so I can use the built-in screenshot
feature of Steam. For others, I play on my PS3 so I use an AverMedia Game
Capture to take screenshots and record videos.

### Making of

The website is staticly generated through Middleman. Styling is done through
Bourbon, Neat and Refills. The upload to Youtube is done through the
`youtube-upload` python lib wrapped in a custom Ruby script. Image gallery is
done through the Fancybox jquery plugin, and a lazy-loader script helps keep the
bandwidth usage reasonable.
