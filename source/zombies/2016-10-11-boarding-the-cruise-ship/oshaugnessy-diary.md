# O'Shaugnessy's diary

## Day one

This cruise started pretty good: after we left the harbor under beautiful
weather, I had some time to retreat to my room and pray the Lord.

I then went to the main ballroom of the ship (the Pinnacle, which by the way
cruises for the first time here), where I was personally welcomed by Mr
Farthington, the friendly ship owner. The scale of this cruise is overwhelming:
three thousand passengers, 100 employees working in the numerous facilities... 
I'm impressed that this ship has a cinema, a casino, even a running track!

I took Farthington's welcoming as an opportunity to ask if there is a chapel:
although I'm trying to get some rest on this ship, I'd love to have a place to
pray and maybe bring the faithful ones I may meet to pray the Lord together.

After the owner's welcome speech, I went to the bar to get a fruit juice (as
usual). I met there an interesting person: Ian McKenzie, an old black man who
spent his life fighting bears in the woods (at least that's what I got from our
conversation). He's pretty friendly, although he seems to have a gambling
problem. (Strong enough for getting tricked by the barman into drinking a weird,
expensive lemony drink that supposedly will increase his luck at gambling)
I'm not sure how he got this addiction, as I never saw bears play poker.

I also noticed an old, weird looking wig guy, who was speaking pretty loud and
was followed by two lost souls that could likely benefit of some moral guidance.
I'll see if I can talk to them later and help them see the Light!

While at the bar, a lousy Texan guy appeared and starting annoying the people
around us, disturbing what looked like a former war hero to tell him aggressive
nonsense (How can one celebrate the violent death of a poor soul? This cannot be
the Lord's plan). Anyway, the former soldier (who was followed by his young
daughter) pushed back the Texan guy and told him to get away. A women that was
dressed like a doctor and introduced herself as Melissa interacted with this guy
and his daughter, bringing her to tears by asking where her mother was.
I suspect she already joined the Lord.

Moments later, the Texan guy (I think I heard his name is Billy) began to look 
sick: he was sweating a lot, and coughing constantly. He was indeed not well, as
he fell on the floor unconscious and was brought by some crew members to the
ships nursery. His wife came in screaming and asking where he was, so I brought
her to the infirmary and went back to the bar.

Some time later, she came back screaming "They're all dead! ALL DEAD!". The
former soldier, the doctor, the wig guy (who seems to think he's a famous star,
although I never heard of him), a well-dressed man that looked like a banker 
and myself were all intrigued by this woman, and came to listen to her.
She said she came back from the nursery, so we all rushed to its direction to see
what happened. And God knows we were not prepared for what was there.

We arrived to the nursery and I immediately saw something was abnormal from the 
amount of blood on the walls. Once I looked inside, I saw four cadavers on the
floor, bloody and some of them having their ribs ripped-off or having some weird
bites on their body (which Ian said does not really look like a bear's).

I then noticed something even stranger, and frankly unholy to me: one of the
four bodies was actually alive, and was EATING the one under it! He soon noticed
our presence and turned toward us: he looked like Bill, the former Texan guy,
but his eyes made me think he was possessed by the Devil. And indeed, he started
moving aggressively to our direction!

I knew we had to stop him, as he was definitely aggressive. While the other guys
tried to close the door, I looked around for something to defend ourselves and 
grabbed the corridor's fire extinguisher. That was useful, as when the wig guy 
(named Brökken or something?) held the door's knob to keep it closed, the 
former soldier took the old gambler's cane and tried to hit Bill through the
door's window. When the window broke under the cane's assault, Bill tried to
hit us: I didn't want to use necessary violence, so I used the main function
of the fire extinguisher to try to fill the room with foam through the window
and incapacitate the Texan guy somehow.

The Lord must have not approved this plan, cause when I tried to execute it
I badly aimed and half the foam ended in the hallway instead of in the nursery.
We were all covered in foam, apart from Brökken who surprisingly kept his wig
perfectly clean. Thank God he was already holding the knob, we would never have
found it under such an amount of foam!

Some security guards arrived and we explained them the situation to Mr Kirkman,
head of the Pinnacle's security team. He told us to go back to our room as they
handle the situation, and to avoid speaking about this episode to any other
passenger to avoid creating a panic. To both thank us and apologize, he offered
to upgrade our rooms to VIP ones tomorrow. I don't really need more space, but I
appreciate the gesture and the kindness of this good fellow. God saves his soul!

## Day two

I was woken up in the middle of the night by screams coming from the hallway.
Listening to my courage, I immediately looked through it and realized the
screams came from a nearby room, in front of which three strong guys were
standing. The wig guy, the doctor and the gambler which were all in nearby rooms
also went out of theirs and went like me to see what was this screaming about.
On the way to the source of the yells, I saw an open room where I recognized the
clothing of a celebrity from my favorite TV Show (I know this is not a very holy
occupation, God forgives me): hearing a woman screaming louder and louder (and
saying things like "Dad, stop it! Are you crazy?"), I grabbed a chair to be able
to physically separate them if anything violent or unholy was happening. The guys
I met yesterday were all following in the corridor, apart from the doctor who
stopped standing and started recording the scene with her cellphone (maybe for
later medical training? Not sure what her intention was there). 
At this point, one of the tough guys ran out of the room screaming and bloody,
and I quickly understood his being frightened: one of his hands was missing!

The following scene was pretty messy: two security guys arrived attracted by the
noise, I put the chair between the father and the daughter (who was defending
herself with a metal bar) and followed Ian's wish to grab a coat hanger
(retrospectively, I should probably have asked why, as today I still don't have
even a remote idea what his intention was with this). Anyway we sorted the
situation out when the guard and the former soldier both shot in the father's
head, and the second shot was the right one (it seems the first one, also
successfully aimed, didn't disturb much this lost soul). 

The security guys escorted us to the main security room, where Mr Kirkman was 
waiting for us looking angry. He asked us bluntly to explain what happened, 
seemingly suspicious that we were twice in such a bloody situation. We did our
best to explain him what happened, that we didn't touch this Bill before he
fainted in the ballroom, and that we stayed in our rooms as instructed until we
heard the screams. The doctor, who discretely recorded the whole conversation,
tried to persuade him to contact the coastal guards and go back to the coast,
as that was already the second violent event we witnessed today and this one 
ended in a dead person (to whom I couldn't even give the last sacraments!)

Mr Kirkman seemed to agree with Melissa, but then Mr Farthington arrived with
the ship's captain and visibly was not considering this an option. Although 
at least two crew members died in the nursery and a passenger was killed, 
he didn't want to involve coastal guards in this incident and told Mr Kirkman 
that he was paid to solve those situations himself, not to call the guards. 
I thought this was out of fear that stopping the cruise would put the future 
of this boat at risk, but I saw him smile weirdly after this conversation. 
That was a bit surprising...

When the owner and Captain King left the room, Kirkman turned to us and told us
that although he didn't trust us fully, we proved we were helping and he wants
us in the security team to help them sort this mess. I of course agreed,
followed by the other guys. He gave us a gun (which we let to the former
soldier, as he has more training than all of us combined). 

Suddenly, our security boss (although my only real master is our Lord) took his
Walkie-Talkie to answer a call. The caller said "They" had broken the nursery's
door and asked for help, and Kirkman rushed to where the call came from without
even looking at us. As their freshly new security squad, we of course ran as
well to what seemed to be the location of the calling security guy.

We arrived in a corridor, where we saw a big pond of blood where two corpses
where. When looking closer, we realized those were actually three: closer to us
was a dying security guard, near to which I immediately crouched to save his
soul from Hell by providing him the last sacraments. I noticed his Walkie-Talkie
fell next to him, and I took it so it could be useful to other sons of our Lord.
But I soon realized the other bodies were not dead either: one of those was
actually chewing on the other one...

The other fellows went to the right of this corridor, as instructed by Kirkman
who wanted to know the source of screams we heard when arriving in the hallway.
They quickly saw a pack of around twelve people running to our direction,
looking frightened by what was behind them. And indeed, following them were
three men covered with blood and with eyes that could have been the Devil's...
